# Hands on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and TensorFlow Code Repo
This repo contains my own experimentation of the code from **Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and TensorFlow** by Aurelien Geron. This is the 2nd edition of the book.

The notebooks are originally created by Aurelien and can be obtained from [here](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2)
